# Introduction

Road traffic safety is a crucial component of urban planning and development. Nowadays governments (and sometimes the private sector) dedicate significant resources to providing ample and sufficient infrastructure to accommodate diverse modes of transportation, thereby increasing the productivity of any given urban area. In this project we examine road safety in the City of Toronto from 2007 to 2017 and explore the areas with highest risk of a traffic incident, controlling for different factors.

# Methods

We define the City of Toronto as per the these guidelines (https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/). Below are the neighborhood limits and the 2016 population estimates:
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=F}
# Loading polygon and population data from the City of Toronto
population <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiosonline/data_sci_geo/master/data/neighbourhoods_planning_areas_wgs84_SEB/Wellbeing_TO_2016%20Census_Total%20Pop_Total%20Change_Age%20Groups.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE,header=T)

require(sf)
shape <- read_sf(dsn = "https://github.com/sergiosonline/data_sci_geo/blob/master/data/neighbourhoods_planning_areas_wgs84_SEB/NEIGHBORHOODS_WGS84.shp?raw=true", layer = "NEIGHBORHOODS_WGS84")

neighborhoods <- shape

# Adding populaation info to neighborhood polygon
neighborhoods <- add_column(neighborhoods, '2016pop'=NA, 'x_coords' = NA, 'y_coords' = NA)

# Separating X and Y coordinates from polygon
for (hood in neighborhoods$AREA_NAME) {
  ## Adding population
  pop = as.numeric(neighborhoods[neighborhoods$AREA_NAME == hood,][["AREA_S_CD"]])
  neighborhoods[neighborhoods$AREA_NAME == hood,]$'2016pop' = 
    population[population$HoodID == pop,]$Pop2016
  ## Adding x-y
  temp = unlist(subset(neighborhoods,AREA_NAME == hood)$geometry[[1]])
  ll = length(temp)
  x_coord = list(temp[1:(ll/2)])
  y_coord = list(temp[((ll/2)+1):ll])
  neighborhoods[neighborhoods$AREA_NAME == hood,]$x_coords = x_coord
  neighborhoods[neighborhoods$AREA_NAME == hood,]$y_coords = y_coord
}

st_write(neighborhoods,"~/Desktop/Grad_School/COURSEWORK/Spring 2019/Data Science/rough work/neighbourhoods_planning_areas_wgs84_SEB/NEIGHBORHOODS_WGS84.shp",
         , delete_layer = TRUE)

neighborhoods <- read_sf(dsn = "~/Desktop/Grad_School/COURSEWORK/Spring 2019/Data Science/rough work/neighbourhoods_planning_areas_wgs84_SEB/", layer = "NEIGHBORHOODS_WGS84")

plot(neighborhoods[3])
```

### Primary Questions

The analysis focuses on answering two main questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Given a collision occurred which areas in Toronto are the most deadly controlling for other factors?
  \item Which factors are related to the collision safety of neighbourhoods?
\end{enumerate}

### Data Collection

For our analysis we employed data from the [Toronto Police Service](http://data.torontopolice.on.ca), the [City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps), and [Environment Canada](http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html). Each of these datasets contains different levels of granularity and information, and were therefore combined to obtain the following variables of interest outlined in **Appendix: Dataset Variables and Definitions**.

### Data Preparation

The following diagram provides an overview of the merged data.

```{r echo = F}
library(kableExtra)
data.frame(Accident_ID = c(5002235651, 5000995174, 5000995174, 1249781),
           Fatal = c(1, 1, 1, 0),
           Date = c("2015-12-30", "2015-06-13", "2015-06-13", "2011-08-04"),
           Neighborhood = c("Greenwood-Coxwell", "Annex", "Annex", "Bay Street Corridor"),
           Population = c(7072, 26703, 26703, 19348),
           `Max_Temp` = c(4.7, 22.3, 22.3, 26.4)) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
  column_spec(5, background = "aliceblue") %>%
  column_spec(6, background = "lavenderblush")
```

Traffic incident information provided by Toronto Police served as a base for the data used for this analysis. Each entry represents a traffic collision event where a person was either killed or seriously injured. Other features such as the location of the collision (intersection, neighborhood, ward), road condition (visibility, road precipitation), driver action (e.g. speeding, involved alcohol), and type of vehicles involved are also available. This is represented in the above figure as the white columns.

Population counts for 2011 and 2016 are available through the national census for each neighborhood. The populations for the dates not provided by the census were extrapolated using a linear growth model. This is represented in the above figure as the blue column.

Historical weather data collected from the station in [University of Toronto](https://goo.gl/maps/g8KZF6SWUw82) was also merged based on the day the accident occurred. This is represented in the above figure as the pink columns.

### Exploratory Analysis

```{r echo = F}
accidents <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiosonline/data_sci_geo/master/data/accidents.csv",
                      check.names = F)

accidents %>% group_by(Neighbourhood) %>%
  summarize(`Total Fatalities` = sum(INJURY == "Fatal", na.rm = T),
            `Total Collisions` = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Total Fatalities`)) %>%
  head()
```

```{r echo = F}
accidents %>% mutate(Pedestrian = INVTYPE == "Pedestrian",
                     Cyclist = INVTYPE == "Cyclist",
                     Other = INVTYPE != "Pedestrian" & INVTYPE != "Cyclist") %>%
  group_by(Neighbourhood) %>%
  summarize(`Total Pedestrian Fatalities` = sum(INJURY == "Fatal" & Pedestrian == 1, na.rm = T),
            `Total Pedestrian Collisions` = sum(Pedestrian == 1, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Total Pedestrian Fatalities`)) %>%
  head()

accidents %>% mutate(Pedestrian = INVTYPE == "Pedestrian",
                     Cyclist = INVTYPE == "Cyclist",
                     Other = INVTYPE != "Pedestrian" & INVTYPE != "Cyclist") %>%
  group_by(Neighbourhood) %>%
  summarize(`Total Cyclist Fatalities` = sum(INJURY == "Fatal" & Cyclist == 1, na.rm = T),
            `Total Cyclist Collisions` = sum(Cyclist == 1, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Total Cyclist Fatalities`)) %>%
  head()

accidents %>% mutate(Pedestrian = INVTYPE == "Pedestrian",
                     Cyclist = INVTYPE == "Cyclist",
                     Other = INVTYPE != "Pedestrian" & INVTYPE != "Cyclist") %>%
  group_by(Neighbourhood) %>%
  summarize(`Total Other Fatalities` = sum(INJURY == "Fatal" & Other == 1, na.rm = T),
            `Total Other Collisions` = sum(Other == 1, na.rm =T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Total Other Fatalities`)) %>%
  head()
```

### Modeling

We model our outcome of interest using a temporal model (to be expanded to spatial in the following iteration).

```{r echo=F}
# Loading final monthly incident data, by neighborhood
#incidentdat <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiosonline/data_sci_geo/master/data/incident_by_year_month_ward_2Mar.csv", header=T, stringsAsFactors = F)

```

# Results




# Conclusions and Discussion

One of the biggest limitations in our project has been data quality and granularity. The data made available by Geotab does not include large areas of the City of Toronto. Moreover, there are plenty missing observations. We also acknowledge the fact that the collision information we procured from the Toronto Police Service may not describe perfectly the actual number of incidents, as there are many of these that are non-fatal or go unreported.
